# My Advent of Code solutions

I wrote a helper script to get the input for at specific day. Use as:

```
./get_input.py --year 2023 --day 1
```
For this to work, you should keep your AOC session cookie in an environment variable by putting the following in your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` file or wherever relevant for your system:

```
export AOCCOOKIE="5c41705e900842b9e297101cd6bf7eb71597a0164c3c982ce2aa44b3b4600fTHISISNOTAREALCOOKIE"
```
